# Smoker Status Prediction

This project is part of the ZAKA Machine Learning Specialization and earned **Top 3** placement on the leaderboard.

## Objective
To develop a classification model that predicts whether an individual is a smoker based on their demographic and health-related features using a U.S. health insurance dataset.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes features such as:
- Age  
- Sex  
- BMI  
- Children  
- Region  
- Charges  
- Smoker status (target)

## Project Workflow
The notebook walks through the full ML pipeline:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Handling Class Imbalance** using SMOTE
5. **Model Building** using a Neural Network
6. **Threshold Tuning** for improving recall
7. **Model Evaluation** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
